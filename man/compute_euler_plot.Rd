\title{Compute and Draw Euler Plot from DEG Table}
\usage{
compute_euler_plot(
  deg_table_in,
  min_to_displayed_threshold = 0.01,
  to_keep = NULL,
  ext_groups = NULL,
  mode_ext_groups = "union",
  inter_batch = NULL,
  mode_inter_batch = NULL,
  shape = "ellipse",
  sort_group_for_region_naming = TRUE,
  path_dir_to_save_plot = NULL,
  dict_uniprot_to_symbol = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deg_table_in}{A data.table with significant DEG results. Must contain
columns: batch, group, type, lfc_abs_lim, min_signif, and data (containing
uniprot IDs). The 'type' column should not contain NA values. Group and
batch names must not contain '&' characters.}

\item{min_to_displayed_threshold}{Numeric; minimal values to display on plots.
If less than 1, interpreted as proportion of universe. Default is 0.01.}

\item{to_keep}{A data.table or data.frame with columns 'batch' and 'group'
to filter the analysis. If NULL, all data is kept. Default is NULL.}

\item{ext_groups}{External groups to include in the analysis. Can be:
a list/vector of UniProt IDs, or a data.table/data.frame with 'batch' and
'group' columns. Default is NULL.}

\item{mode_ext_groups}{Character; mode for external groups when ext_groups
is a table. Must be "individual", "union", or "intersect". Default is "union".}

\item{inter_batch}{A named list specifying batches to compare for inter-batch
analysis. If NULL and mode_inter_batch is not NULL, includes all batches.
Default is NULL.}

\item{mode_inter_batch}{A named list specifying the mode ("union" or "intersect")
for each inter-batch comparison. If NULL, no inter-batch comparison is performed.
Default is NULL.}

\item{shape}{Character; shape for Euler diagrams. Default is "ellipse".}

\item{sort_group_for_region_naming}{Logical; whether to sort group names
alphabetically in region names. Default is TRUE.}

\item{path_dir_to_save_plot}{Character; directory path to save individual
plots as PDF files. If NULL, plots are not saved. Default is NULL.}

\item{dict_uniprot_to_symbol}{Named character vector mapping UniProt IDs
to gene symbols. If NULL and 'symbol' column exists in input data, it will
be reconstructed from the input table. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{euler_plots}{A list of Euler plot objects}
\item{dt_region_content}{A data.table with specific content of each region
in the same format as the input deg_table_in}
}
}
\description{
Computes and draws Euler plots based on significant differential expression
gene (DEG) tables. The analysis is performed at the UniProt level, with
NA values ignored. The function supports both intra-batch and inter-batch
comparisons with various customization options.
}
\details{
The comparison is performed using UniProt IDs. The function handles both
intra-batch comparisons (comparing groups within the same batch) and
inter-batch comparisons (comparing batches across different conditions).
