\title{Draw Single Euler Plot}
\usage{
draw_single_euler_plot(
  sets,
  min_to_displayed_threshold = 0.01,
  shape = "ellipse",
  title = NULL,
  save_path_file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sets}{A named list of character vectors representing the sets to compare.}

\item{min_to_displayed_threshold}{Numeric; minimal values to display on the plot.
If less than 1, interpreted as a proportion of the universe (total unique elements
across all sets). If 1 or greater, interpreted as an absolute count. Default is 0.01.}

\item{shape}{Character; shape of the Euler diagram. Default is "ellipse".}

\item{title}{Character; title for the plot. Default is NULL.}

\item{save_path_file}{Character; file path to save the plot. If NULL, plot is
not saved. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
An Euler plot object that can be displayed or further customized.
}
\description{
Creates a simple Euler diagram for visualizing overlaps between sets.
This function generates an Euler plot with customizable display thresholds
and styling options, with optional saving to file.

\examples{
sets <- list(
  "Set A" = c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3"),
  "Set B" = c("gene2", "gene3", "gene4"),
  "Set C" = c("gene3", "gene4", "gene5")
)
plot <- draw_single_euler_plot(sets, title = "Gene Overlap")
