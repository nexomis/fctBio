\title{Extend Gene List Using TRRUST Database}
\usage{
extend_trrust(
  input_genes,
  trrust_db = system.file("extdata/human_network_annotations/trrust/data.tab", package =
    "fctBio"),
  add_tf = TRUE,
  add_target = TRUE,
  keep_input_without_hit = TRUE,
  ignore_single_pmid = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_genes}{A character vector of input gene symbols to extend.}

\item{trrust_db}{A character string specifying the path to the TRRUST database
in TSV format. Defaults to the package's internal TRRUST data file.}

\item{add_tf}{Logical; whether to add transcription factors that regulate
the input genes. When \code{TRUE}, includes TFs that have the input genes as targets,
while preserving any input genes that are already TFs in the database.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{add_target}{Logical; whether to add target genes that are regulated
by the input genes. When \code{TRUE}, includes targets of input genes that act as TFs,
while preserving any input genes that are already targets in the database.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{keep_input_without_hit}{Logical; whether to retain input genes that
have no regulatory relationships in the database (neither as TFs nor as targets).
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ignore_single_pmid}{Logical; whether to exclude regulatory relationships
that are supported by only one PubMed ID reference. When \code{TRUE}, only
relationships with multiple literature references are considered. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of unique gene symbols representing the extended
gene list. The returned genes include the original input genes (if
\code{keep_input_without_hit} is \code{TRUE}) plus any additional TFs and/or targets
based on the specified parameters.
}
\description{
\code{extend_trrust} extends a list of input genes by adding linked transcription
factors (TFs) and/or target genes based on the TRRUST database. This function
allows for flexible gene network expansion by including regulatory relationships
from the TRRUST (Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by
Sentence-based Text mining) database.

The function can selectively add transcription factors that regulate the input
genes and/or target genes that are regulated by the input genes. It also
provides options to filter relationships based on literature support and to
retain input genes that have no regulatory relationships in the database.

# Basic usage with default parameters
extended_genes <- extend_trrust(
  input_genes = c("BAX", "MYC", "TP53")

# Add only transcription factors, exclude single PMID relationships

  input_genes = c("BAX", "MYC", "TP53"),
  add_tf = TRUE,
  add_target = FALSE,
  ignore_single_pmid = TRUE
)

# Add only targets, don't keep input genes without hits
target_extended <- extend_trrust(
  input_genes = c("BAX", "MYC", "TP53"),
  add_tf = FALSE,
